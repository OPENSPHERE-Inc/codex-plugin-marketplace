As the review-report aggregation owner, consolidate the individual reviews under `{{tmp_dir}}/reviews/` into a single final report. Do not perform triage (that is $creview:triage's responsibility). Read `{{plugin_root}}/rules/sub-agent.md` and observe the common prohibitions.

Input: `{{reviewer_paths_list}}`
Output file: `{{final_doc_path}}`
Round number: `{{round_num_or_omitted}}`
Review target: `{{targets_description}}`
Reviewer list: `{{reviewer_names_csv}}`
Review mode: `{{review_mode}}`
Output language: `{{doc_lang}}`

Consolidation procedure:

1. Read each reviewer file. Its reviewer name is the basename without the `review-` prefix and the `.md` suffix. Extract the severity and categories from the leading `[severity] [category]` of each finding.
2. Deduplicate — merge findings at the same location with the same intent into a single entry, listing the originating reviewers together. Take the union of categories from the merged sources, join with `/` (preserve first-occurrence order, drop duplicates).
3. Group by severity (Critical → Major → Minor → Info).
4. Within each group, assign finding-ids (Critical: C-1, C-2, ...; Major: M-1, M-2, ...; Minor: mi-1, mi-2, ...; Info: I-1, I-2, ...). The Minor prefix is the lowercase two-letter `mi-`, which does not collide with Major's `M-`.
5. Read `{{plugin_root}}/skills/start/templates/review-doc.md` to grasp the skeleton, and Write to `{{final_doc_path}}` following the format rules below.

Format rules:

- Each finding is an independent subsection with the heading `### {finding-id} — `{location}` [{categories}]`. Join `{categories}` with `/` inside a single `[ ]`. If a reviewer's output omits the category bracket, the heading may omit the category bracket as well.
- For each finding, list metadata (reviewers) as bullets, and below that write the "Finding" with a bold label.
- After the finding body and before the `---` separator, place the metadata insertion markers `<!-- METADATA({finding-id}) -->` and `<!-- /METADATA({finding-id}) -->`, separated from surrounding content by blank lines. Output the space between the markers as empty (a later step inserts metadata mechanically).
- Separate findings with a `---` horizontal rule. Do not output a Status line (it is outside this skill's responsibility).
- For severity sections with no applicable findings (`## Critical` / `## Major` / `## Minor` / `## Info`), do not omit the heading; output the heading and write the `No findings` equivalent in `{{doc_lang}}` in the body.
- Write the prose (finding descriptions, summary body, metadata heading labels) in `{{doc_lang}}`. Structural anchors (severity headings `## Critical` / `## Major` / `## Minor` / `## Info`, finding-id, `<!-- METADATA(...) -->` markers) are parsing targets for later phases, so they do not change regardless of `{{doc_lang}}`. Use the category labels exactly as written in the reviewer output.
- When `{{review_mode}}` is `adversarial`, add `- **Mode:** adversarial` to the report header bullets, immediately after the Round bullet, or after the Date bullet when the round number is omitted. The label follows `{{doc_lang}}`; keep the value `adversarial` as-is. Otherwise, do not output the bullet.

Return value: `{doc_path, findings_total, severity_counts: {critical, major, minor, info}, duplicates_merged, template_id}`. Include `template_id` exactly as Read from this template's frontmatter.
