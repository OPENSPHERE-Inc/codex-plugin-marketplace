---

Read `{{diff_path}}` and conduct an adversarial code review. Read `{{plugin_root}}/rules/sub-agent.md` and observe the common prohibitions.

Targets: `{{targets}}` (base: `{{base}}`)

Scope: `{{scope_paths}}` — the changed files assigned to you. The other changed files in `{{diff_path}}` belong to another reviewer.

Rules:

- Use read-only file inspection and search tools. Do not rerun git diff/log/show; the review input is already consolidated in `{{diff_path}}`.
- Review the changed hunks under the scope paths, and cover all of them before returning; do not stop at a finding count. Anchor every finding at a line inside a scope path — a cause lying outside the scope may be cited in the description, but a finding located outside it belongs to another reviewer.
- Severity labels: Critical (fatal, must fix) / Major (medium risk, should fix) / Minor (caution) / Info (informational).
- Category labels: assign one or more category labels indicating the nature of the finding. Presets: `Bug` / `Maintainability` / `Readability` / `Testing` / `Performance` / `Security` / `Style` / `Documentation` / `Design`. If no preset fits, create a new label (short noun phrase, must not contain `/` or `]`). When multiple apply, join with `/` inside a single `[ ]`. The label body itself may be written in `{{doc_lang}}` (preset names may be substituted with translations).
- Read `{{plugin_root}}/rules/review.md` and follow it.

Adversarial stance:

- Read the changed code on the assumption that it is broken. For each changed unit, look for a counterexample first; pass a path only after confirming it does not break.
- State a concrete failure scenario in every Critical / Major finding: the triggering input or state, and the resulting wrong result, crash, leak, or deadlock. Keep a finding at Minor or below when you cannot state one. When the target's defects do not manifest as runtime behavior (prompts, documentation, manifests, etc.), substitute the sequence by which the target is misread or misexecuted, and the resulting wrong outcome, for the failure scenario.
- Walk these attack axes for each changed unit: concurrency and lock ordering / lifetime and ownership / error paths and rollback on partial failure / boundary values and overflow / resource exhaustion / adversarial input / reentrancy and recursion / backward compatibility and migration / platform differences / trust boundaries and input provenance / permission scope / handling of secrets and data exfiltration. Skip an axis that does not apply to the nature of the target.
- Trace instead of guessing: Read the callers, the release order, and the failure-path branches of the changed code before concluding.
- `{{plugin_root}}/rules/review.md` applies unchanged in adversarial mode. Adversarial means depth per finding, not a larger count; do not pad the list with preference-based findings that carry no failure scenario.

Output:

- Write only a numbered list in the format `[severity] [category] file_path:line — Description of the issue and its importance.` to `{{output_path}}` (no preamble or postamble).
  - Category examples: `[Bug]` / `[Maintainability/Readability]` / `[Testing]`.
  - `line` is the actual line number in the target file. Do not use a hunk header (`@@ -a,b +c,d @@`) or a position within `{{diff_path}}` as the line number (diff positions do not match real file line numbers). Use the diff only to locate what changed; obtain the line number by Read-ing the target file and using the line number Read reports (which is the real file line number). Added/changed lines point to the matching line in the current file; deleted lines point to the nearest surrounding line.
- Write the issue description in `{{doc_lang}}`. Keep `file_path:line` and the severity labels (Critical / Major / Minor / Info) as-is.
- Return value: `{"path": "{{output_path}}", "critical": <int>, "major": <int>, "minor": <int>, "info": <int>, "template_id": "<template_id from this template>"}`
