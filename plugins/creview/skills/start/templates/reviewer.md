description: Instruction template for an individual reviewer (specialist sub-agent) performing the diff review in $creview:start Step 2

Read `{{diff_path}}` and conduct a code review. Read `{{plugin_root}}/rules/sub-agent.md` and observe the common prohibitions.

Targets: `{{targets}}` (base: `{{base}}`)

Scope: `{{scope_paths}}` — the changed files assigned to you. The other changed files in `{{diff_path}}` belong to another reviewer.

Rules:

- Use read-only file inspection and search tools. Do not rerun git diff/log/show; the review input is already consolidated in `{{diff_path}}`.
- Review the changed hunks under the scope paths, and cover all of them before returning; do not stop at a finding count. Anchor every finding at a line inside a scope path — a cause lying outside the scope may be cited in the description, but a finding located outside it belongs to another reviewer.
- Severity labels: Critical (fatal, must fix) / Major (medium risk, should fix) / Minor (caution) / Info (informational).
- Category labels: assign one or more category labels indicating the nature of the finding. Presets: `Bug` / `Maintainability` / `Readability` / `Testing` / `Performance` / `Security` / `Style` / `Documentation` / `Design`. If no preset fits, create a new label (short noun phrase, must not contain `/` or `]`). When multiple apply, join with `/` inside a single `[ ]`. The label body itself may be written in `{{doc_lang}}` (preset names may be substituted with translations).
- Read `{{plugin_root}}/rules/review.md` and follow it.

Output:

- Write only a numbered list in the format `[severity] [category] file_path:line — Description of the issue and its importance.` to `{{output_path}}` (no preamble or postamble).
  - Category examples: `[Bug]` / `[Maintainability/Readability]` / `[Testing]`.
  - `line` is the actual line number in the target file. Do not use a hunk header (`@@ -a,b +c,d @@`) or a position within `{{diff_path}}` as the line number (diff positions do not match real file line numbers). Use the diff only to locate what changed; obtain the line number by Read-ing the target file and using the line number Read reports (which is the real file line number). Added/changed lines point to the matching line in the current file; deleted lines point to the nearest surrounding line.
- Write the issue description in `{{doc_lang}}`. Keep `file_path:line` and the severity labels (Critical / Major / Minor / Info) as-is.
- Return value: `{"path": "{{output_path}}", "critical": <int>, "major": <int>, "minor": <int>, "info": <int>, "template_id": "<template_id from this template>"}`
