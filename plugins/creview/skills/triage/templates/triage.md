As the triage owner of the review document, Read `{{document_path}}`, perform stage classification and adversarial triage (propose → parallel challenges → majority-gated adjudication) for each finding, and Write the final result to `{{tmp_dir}}/triage.jsonl`. Read `{{plugin_root}}/rules/sub-agent.md` and observe the common prohibitions.

Preconditions:

- `{{tmp_dir}}` is created in advance by the leader via `mkdir -p`. The Sub must not perform existence checks (`Test-Path` / `ls`, etc.) or mkdir. Your own filesystem writes are the two files `triage-draft.jsonl` and `triage.jsonl`. The challenge sub-agents and the adjudication sub-agent you launch write the `challenge-{b}-{n}.jsonl` / `adjudication.jsonl` that their own templates specify.
- The paths passed (`{{document_path}}` / `{{tmp_dir}}`) are relative. Do not convert them to absolute paths.

If `{{previous_round_doc_paths}}` is provided (empty in the standard Round 1 flow), Read each file and extract past-round decision information (id / location / description / METADATA's triage / estimate / status / verification) for reference during triage. No need to consult when empty or `(none)`.

Extraction targets: Critical / Major / Minor sections (skip Info). For each finding, obtain id (C-1, M-1, mi-1, etc.) / severity / location / description (the body up to the marker) / current_meta (the current values of triage / estimate / status / verification; when the same field appears multiple times, use the last value).

Stage classification (based on current_meta):

- Marker is empty → pending_triage
- triage: 🔧 Will Fix, no estimate → pending_estimate
- estimate: ▶️ Maintain or 🚧 Alternative, no status → pending_fix
- verification last value is 💬 Feedback → feedback (re-fix target)
- triage: 🚫 Won't Fix → wontfix_skip
- estimate: 🔻 Downgrade → downgrade_skip
- status: 🟢 Fixed, no verification or last value is ✅ Verified → fixed_skip

Only findings whose stage is pending_triage or feedback are decision targets. For other stages, count only and do not perform a triage decision.

Decision categories:

- Will Fix — Valid; should be addressed.
- Won't Fix — Not applicable / false positive / risk accepted (reason required).
- Needs Investigation — Settle on Will Fix / Won't Fix after investigating the source.

Read `{{plugin_root}}/rules/wontfix.md` and apply it when the verdict is `Won't Fix`.

Procedure:

1. Make the primary decision for each decision target and Write `{{tmp_dir}}/triage-draft.jsonl`. Do not resolve the assignee at this stage.
2. When the draft `items` is empty, skip steps 3 and 4, Write `{{tmp_dir}}/triage.jsonl` with `items: []`, `will_fix_count: 0`, `wontfix_count: 0`, and the draft's `by_stage`, and return with `flipped_count: 0` and `adjudication_skipped: true`.
3. Split the draft `items` into batches of at most 8 ids in draft order. Launch three independent challenge agents per batch with `collaboration.spawn_agent(task_name="triage_challenge_{b}_{n}_{attempt}", message=..., fork_turns="all")`. Fill only available collaboration slots and queue the rest. Do not specify the model. Fill the variables into the launch message (`{b}` is the batch number, `{n}` the challenge index, and `{batch_ids}` the comma-separated ids):

```
As your first action, you MUST Read `{{plugin_root}}/skills/triage/templates/triage-challenge.md`. Do not perform any other judgment, action, or tool call before the Read completes. After reading, follow its instructions.

Variables (substitute into the template's {{...}} placeholders):
- plugin_root: {{plugin_root}}
- document_path: {{document_path}}
- tmp_dir: {{tmp_dir}}
- previous_round_doc_paths: {{previous_round_doc_paths}}
- batch_index: {b}
- challenge_index: {n}
- ids: {batch_ids}

Round-specific overrides (apply after following the template's instructions):
- (none)

Include `template_id` (Read from the template's frontmatter) in the return value.
```

Wait for each child with `collaboration.wait_agent`. Verify that every returned `template_id` matches `b8701509-403b-488b-8b13-c867f9c6700b`. Retry a mismatch once with a new task name and the same variables. A pair that mismatches twice or cannot be spawned produces no challenge output; continue with matching outputs.

Overturning a draft decision takes two flip votes from the id's own batch, so when no batch produced two or more challenge outputs, skip step 4, adopt the draft `verdict` / `reason` as the final verdicts, Write `{{tmp_dir}}/triage.jsonl` following step 5, and return with `flipped_count: 0` and `adjudication_skipped: true`.

4. After all challenge children finish, launch adjudication with `collaboration.spawn_agent(task_name="triage_adjudicate_{attempt}", message=..., fork_turns="all")`. Do not specify the model. Fill the variables into the launch message:

```
As your first action, you MUST Read `{{plugin_root}}/skills/triage/templates/triage-adjudicate.md`. Do not perform any other judgment, action, or tool call before the Read completes. After reading, follow its instructions.

Variables (substitute into the template's {{...}} placeholders):
- plugin_root: {{plugin_root}}
- document_path: {{document_path}}
- tmp_dir: {{tmp_dir}}
- previous_round_doc_paths: {{previous_round_doc_paths}}
- challenge_paths: {comma-separated {{tmp_dir}}/challenge-{b}-{n}.jsonl paths that were produced}

Round-specific overrides (apply after following the template's instructions):
- (none)

Include `template_id` (Read from the template's frontmatter) in the return value.
```

Wait with `collaboration.wait_agent`. Retry a template-ID mismatch once with a new task name. After two mismatches, return `{path: null, error: "adjudicate template_id mismatch twice", template_id}` without writing `triage.jsonl`. When the child cannot be spawned, adopt the draft decisions, write `triage.jsonl` as in step 5, and return `flipped_count: 0` and `adjudication_skipped: true`.

5. Adopt each adjudicated `verdict` and `reason` as-is. For confirmed Will Fix items only, apply `{{plugin_root}}/rules/agents-detection.md` and store the selected profile name and path. For a missing or invalid adjudication item, retain the draft decision. If adjudication cannot be read, retain all draft decisions and set `flipped_count: 0`.

`{{tmp_dir}}/triage-draft.jsonl` format: `{items: [{id, severity, location, stage, verdict (Will Fix | Won't Fix), reason}], by_stage: {<stage>: <int>}}` (settle Needs Investigation into either verdict before writing)

`{{tmp_dir}}/triage.jsonl` format: `{items: [{id, verdict, assignee (null for Won't Fix), profile_path (null when unavailable), reason, memo_value}], will_fix_count, wontfix_count, by_stage: {<stage>: <int>}}`

Counting basis: `will_fix_count` / `wontfix_count` / `by_assignee` / `memo_value` follow the final verdicts. `by_stage` carries over from the draft. `flipped_count` is the number of items with `flipped == true` in `adjudication.jsonl`.

Write the `reason` and `memo_value` prose in the same language as the existing Finding descriptions in `{{document_path}}` (the `🔧 Will Fix` / `🚫 Won't Fix` labels and emoji, and `(assignee: ...)`, stay fixed).

memo_value format:

- Will Fix: `🔧 Will Fix (assignee: {assignee}) — {reason}`
- Won't Fix: `🚫 Won't Fix — {reason}`

Return `{path, will_fix_count, wontfix_count, flipped_count, by_stage, by_assignee: [{assignee, profile_path, ids: [id, ...]}], template_id}`. Add `adjudication_skipped: true` when applicable. Do not return decision bodies. Return this template's `template_id` unchanged.
