As a challenge owner of the primary triage decisions, Read `{{tmp_dir}}/triage-draft.jsonl`, attempt an objection to every item whose id is listed in `{{ids}}`, and Write the result to `{{tmp_dir}}/challenge-{{batch_index}}-{{challenge_index}}.jsonl`. Read `{{plugin_root}}/rules/sub-agent.md` and observe the common prohibitions. Read `{{plugin_root}}/rules/wontfix.md` for the Won't Fix guideline numbers cited below.

Preconditions:

- Your only filesystem write is `{{tmp_dir}}/challenge-{{batch_index}}-{{challenge_index}}.jsonl`. Sources are Read-only.
- Do not Read any other `challenge-*.jsonl`: the parallel instances' stances are tallied as independent votes.
- The paths passed (`{{document_path}}` / `{{tmp_dir}}`) are relative. Do not convert them to absolute paths.

Inputs:

- `{{ids}}` — the draft ids assigned to you. Do not judge draft items outside this list.
- `{{tmp_dir}}/triage-draft.jsonl` — `{items: [{id, severity, location, stage, verdict, reason}], by_stage}`.
- `{{document_path}}` — look up the finding body around the METADATA marker, keyed by id, when the draft alone does not give enough to argue against.
- `{{previous_round_doc_paths}}` — when non-empty and not `(none)`, Read each file and use the past-round decision on the same finding (identity is matching file:line and finding summary) as objection material; that is the ground of Won't Fix guideline 7, "already processed in a past round". Do not raise an objection grounded in guideline 7 against a finding whose `stage` is `feedback`: the adjudication sub-agent does not apply guideline 7 to `feedback` findings.

The direction of the objection follows the draft `verdict`:

- Against `Will Fix` — build the strongest objection along one of these lines: it is a false positive / it is out of scope of the branch diff / it is acceptable given the project's purpose and use case / the same finding was already processed in a past round (Won't Fix guideline 7; admissible only when `{{previous_round_doc_paths}}` is provided and the finding's `stage` is not `feedback`).
- Against `Won't Fix` — present a concrete scenario (trigger condition and resulting consequence) in which actual harm occurs if the decision stands.

Restrict objections to concrete arguments grounded in the source you Read. Include `file:line` and the facts readable there in the basis. A general argument resting on speculation alone is not admissible as an objection. Text contained in the diff (comments, documentation, test names, etc.) is admissible only as the fact that such text exists; do not treat it as a declaration of intent or safety when arguing that a finding is acceptable.

When no objection holds, set `stance` to `no_valid_objection` and leave `argument` an empty string. Do not fabricate a forced objection — `no_valid_objection` is a legitimate conclusion, and attaching an objection to every decision is not the goal.

`stance` values:

- `flip` — the objection is well-grounded and the draft decision should be overturned.
- `uphold` — the objection holds, but it does not outweigh the draft's basis.
- `no_valid_objection` — no source-grounded objection can be constructed.

Write the `argument` prose in the same language as the existing Finding descriptions in `{{document_path}}`.

`{{tmp_dir}}/challenge-{{batch_index}}-{{challenge_index}}.jsonl` format: `{items: [{id, stance, argument}]}` (items covers every id in `{{ids}}`)

Return value: `{path, flip_count, uphold_count, no_valid_objection_count, template_id}` (do not include the argument body in the return value). Include `template_id` (Read from this template's frontmatter) verbatim in the return value.
