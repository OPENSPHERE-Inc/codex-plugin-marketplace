description: Prompt for the select-fix-targets sub-agent in $creview:respond Step 1 that extracts fix targets and their assignees from the review document metadata

As the fix-target selection owner, Read the review document `{{document_path}}`, apply the fix-target selection rule, and Write `{{tmp_dir}}/targets.jsonl`. Read `{{plugin_root}}/rules/sub-agent.md` and observe the common prohibitions.

Preconditions:

- `{{tmp_dir}}` is created in advance by the leader. The only filesystem write is targets.jsonl. Do not run existence checks or mkdir.
- `{{document_path}}` / `{{tmp_dir}}` are relative paths. Do not convert them to absolute.

Extraction targets: Critical / Major / Minor sections (skip Info). For each finding, read the values inside `<!-- METADATA(id) -->` … `<!-- /METADATA(id) -->`. When a field repeats, use the last value.

A finding is a fix target when **all** of the following hold:

- `Triage:` is `🔧 Will Fix`. Parse the assignee from `(assignee: {specialist})`. When no assignee is parseable, use `general-purpose`.
- `Estimate:` is `▶️ Maintain` or `🚧 Alternative`.
- No `Status:` line is present, or `Verification:` is `💬 Feedback`. Metadata is append-only, so a finding sent back for a re-fix still carries the earlier `Status:`.

Skip (not a fix target): `Triage: 🚫 Won't Fix`, `Estimate: 🔻 Downgrade`, a finding whose `Status:` is present with no `Verification:` or with `✅ Verified`, and findings with no `Triage:` or no `Estimate:` (run `$creview:triage` first — record these in `not_ready` with the reason).

For each fix target, extract fix_plan from the part after ` — Plan: ` on the `Estimate:` line. Split on the leading `(1) ` and subsequent ` (n) ` numbered markers into a string array, one entry per element. When there is no ` — Plan: ` segment, set fix_plan to an empty array.

When the `Estimate:` line carries an ` — ADR: {filename}` segment immediately before ` — Plan: `, set `adr` to the filename; otherwise `adr` is null. The segment is not part of fix_plan.

`{{tmp_dir}}/targets.jsonl` format: `{items: [{id, assignee, estimate (Maintain|Alternative), adr (filename or null), fix_plan (string array, [] when absent)}], fix_count, not_ready: [{id, reason}]}`

Return value: `{path, fix_count, by_assignee: [{assignee, ids: [id, ...]}], template_id}` (`by_assignee` groups the fix targets by assignee; do not include finding bodies). Include `template_id` (Read from this template's frontmatter) verbatim in the return value.
