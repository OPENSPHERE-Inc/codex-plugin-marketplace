Fix the assigned findings `{{ids}}` sequentially. Read `{{plugin_root}}/rules/sub-agent.md` and observe the common prohibitions.

Inputs (look up by id == "{finding-id}"):

- Review document `{{document_path}}` — Obtain description / location from around the METADATA marker, and the finding's resolved decision from the metadata block: `Triage:` (Will Fix + reason) and `Estimate:` (▶️ Maintain or 🚧 Alternative, with Cost / Future / Signals and, for Alternative, the FIXME-insertion direction). When a field repeats, use the last value.
- `{{tmp_dir}}/targets.jsonl` — `items[]` gives each id's `assignee`, `estimate` (Maintain | Alternative), `adr` (the finding's ADR filename in the review document's directory, or null), and `fix_plan` (the fix plan finalized during `$creview:triage` estimation; a string array of `{file:line — what to change}` entries, possibly empty).

For each id:

1. Take the `fix_plan` of this id from targets.jsonl as the starting point. Read the related source to grasp the current context. Its line numbers are from estimation time and may have drifted due to source changes, so treat fix_plan as intent and apply it against the current source. When `fix_plan` is empty (legacy docs with no `Plan:` segment, etc.), derive the fix approach from description / `Estimate:`. When `adr` is non-null, Read the ADR file in the directory of `{{document_path}}`; it may carry user edits made after estimation, and on conflict its Decision takes precedence over fix_plan.
2. Implement the fix (conform to the coding conventions in AGENTS.md):
   - Estimate ▶️ Maintain: a normal fix applying each edit in fix_plan.
   - Estimate 🚧 Alternative: add a FIXME: comment only (no logic change). Use the comment wording in fix_plan (or, if absent, the FIXME-insertion direction in `Estimate:`).
3. Self-review: Re-read the changed locations, check for new issues introduced (regressions, thread safety, resource leaks, etc.), and fix any found before reporting.
4. When the fix includes added or changed comments, Read `{{plugin_root}}/rules/comment.md` and self-check the added/changed comments against that discipline. Fix any violations before reporting.
   - Write a `FIXME:` / `TODO:` only for the 🚧 Alternative case in step 2. Such an annotation stands permanently as grounds for excluding that spot from review, so do not mark a residual gap you noticed while fixing: under ▶️ Maintain, fix it when it falls within this finding's scope; otherwise leave it unannotated.
5. ADR:
   - `adr` non-null: update the ADR — set Status to `Accepted`, append a History entry (date = the date part of `{{timestamp}}` as YYYY-MM-DD, `{review document filename} / {finding-id}`, one-line fix summary). Record any deviation from its Decision and any design decision made during implementation in Decision / Consequences.
   - `adr` null, `{{adr_flag}}` on, and the implementation itself chose one of multiple viable approaches with lasting trade-offs: Write `{basename of {{document_path}} without .md}-adr-{finding-id}.md` in the review document's directory with Status `Accepted` and a Created History entry, following the skeleton in `{{plugin_root}}/rules/adr-format.md`, and append ` — ADR: {filename}` to memo_value.
6. Write to `{{tmp_dir}}/statuses/{finding-id}.jsonl`.

Parallelization constraints (when handling multiple ids):

- Multiple ids that affect the same file are processed sequentially (to prevent write conflicts).
- ids that affect different files may be processed in parallel.

`{{tmp_dir}}/statuses/{finding-id}.jsonl` format: `{id, specialist, verdict (the targets.jsonl estimate; Maintain | Alternative), description (concise description of the fix), memo_value, files (repo-relative paths of the source files this fix changed)}`

Write the `description` and `memo_value` prose in the same language as the existing Finding descriptions in `{{document_path}}` (the `🟢 Fixed` label and emoji stay fixed).

memo_value format (when step 5 created a new ADR, append ` — ADR: {filename}`):

- Maintain: `🟢 Fixed — {fix description}`
- Alternative: `🟢 Fixed — FIXME comment inserted at {file:line}` (description carries the same intent)

Return value: `{items: [{id, path}, ...], template_id}` (items covers all assigned ids). Include `template_id` (Read from this template's frontmatter) verbatim in the return value.
