As the format / build / test verification owner, run the destination project's format, build, and test procedures once each (test only when a test procedure is resolved). Do not run a fix loop (after the leader has a specialist Sub fix the code, the leader relaunches this Sub). Only on failure, read the code, analyze the cause, and identify the responsible specialist. Source changes are limited to formatter auto-fixes (logic changes forbidden). Read `{{plugin_root}}/rules/sub-agent.md` and observe the common prohibitions.

Inputs: working directory `{{tmp_dir}}`, fix diff `{{diff_path}}` (`fetch_diff.py` output; the current fixes), attempt number `{{attempt_num}}` (informational only).

The command execution CWD is assumed to be the project root. Do not use absolute paths; use relative paths only. Do not use `tee` / `Tee-Object` through a pipe, and do not use compound commands (`;` / `&&`) (the Bash tool returns the exit code automatically).

Procedure:

1. Preparation (workflow resolution and diff classification):
   - Resolve the format / build / test commands and `workflow_source` via the procedure in `{{plugin_root}}/rules/build-format-detection.md`. If `workflow_source == "none"`, do not run anything automatically and enter step 5.
   - Read `{{diff_path}}` (the current fix diff) and classify the changes. If the changes are exclusively of a kind that cannot affect a given stage's outcome (comments only / documentation- or non-source-files only / whitespace- or formatting-only), mark that stage (build / test) as skip-eligible (do not run it, `ran = false`, note the skip reason in `summary_line`). When in doubt, do not skip — run it.

2. Format verification (only when a format command was resolved):
   - Get the list of changed files via git.
   - If the resolved format command has a verification (dry-run) form, run it and run the auto-fix form if there are violations. If there is no verification form, apply the auto-fix form to the changed files and determine whether anything was fixed via the git diff.
   - Follow the resolved descriptor / document for selecting format targets (extensions, directories, etc.).

3. Build verification (only when a build command was resolved and the stage is not skip-eligible; `build.ran = true`):
   - If the resolved workflow has a configure command, run it first, then run the build command. Redirect output to `{{tmp_dir}}/build.log` (the preceding command with `>`, the following command with `>>` to append).
   - If the descriptor / document specifies how to select platform differences (preset names, etc.), follow it. Otherwise pick the straightforward value for the current platform.
   - The moment configure or build exits non-zero, treat it as a failure: set `build.success = false`, set `failure.stage = "build"`, and proceed to step 6. If no build command, or the stage is skip-eligible, do not run it and set `build.ran = false`.

4. Test verification (only when a test command was resolved, the build did not fail, and the stage is not skip-eligible; `test.ran = true`):
   - Run the resolved test command, appending output to `{{tmp_dir}}/build.log` (`>>`). On a non-zero exit, treat it as a failure: set `test.success = false`, set `failure.stage = "test"`, and proceed to step 6.
   - If no test command, or the stage is skip-eligible, do not run it and set `test.ran = false`. Run the test even when there was no build (`build.ran = false`).

5. Visual check only (`workflow_source == "none"`):
   - Do not run the formatter / build / test (`build.ran` / `test.ran` are false). Read the git-changed files and check, to the extent visually determinable, for syntax breakage, unresolved symbols, obvious format breakage, etc.
   - Set `format` to a value indicating not executed, and set `workflow_warning` to "Format / build procedure is not declared, so automatic verification was skipped. Adding `.codex/rules/build-format.md` is recommended."
   - Set `failure.stage = "visual"` and perform step 6 only if you find an obvious breakage visually.

6. Specialist identification on failure (`failure != null`):
   - Read `failure.log_path` (`{{tmp_dir}}/build.log`; absent in visual mode) and the error-producing files (in visual mode, the broken files), analyze the cause, and set `failure.error_summary` / `failure.error_files` / `failure.fix_guidance`.
   - Specialist selection: resolve the agent via the procedure in `{{plugin_root}}/rules/agents-detection.md`. Match target is the error content (language / build system / subsystem / test framework); the result field is `failure.suggested_specialist`.

7. Write to `{{tmp_dir}}/format-build-result.jsonl`.

`{{tmp_dir}}/format-build-result.jsonl` format:

```
{
  "workflow_source": "build-format.md | AGENTS.md | README.md | none",
  "workflow_warning": <string> | null,
  "format": {changed_files: [...], format_violations_fixed: <int>, format_violations_remaining: <int>},
  "build": {ran: <bool>, success: <bool>},
  "test": {ran: <bool>, success: <bool>},
  "failure": {stage: "build | test | visual", log_path, error_summary | null, error_files: ["src/foo.cpp:42", ...] | null, suggested_specialist | null, fix_guidance | null} | null
}
```

Return value: `{path, success, format_violations_fixed, workflow_source, workflow_warning, summary_line (<=200 chars, e.g. "build-format.md / format ok / build ok / test ok" or "build-format.md / format ok / build skipped (comments only) / test skipped" or "none / visual-only: no workflow declared"), template_id}`. `success` is `failure == null`. For a stage that did not run (`ran = false`), its `build.success` / `test.success` is `true` (counts as passing). Include `template_id` (Read from this template's frontmatter) verbatim in the return value.
